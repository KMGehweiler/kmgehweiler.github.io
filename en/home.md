# Hi there!

I'm Karin.

I'm not a Data Analyst.   
Not just a Data Analyst anyway.

My passion are the creation of order out of chaos and restructuring it for everyone to use.
That sounds a bit abstract so let me make it more concrete with a couple of topics that I'm interested in:
* organization
* design
* minimalism
* helping others
* data visualization

I also like languages and volunteer as an English-German translator for Asian dramas on viki.com. I hope I can improve my Korean in the foreseeable future to also be able to translate Korean-English.

Check out my
* [skills- & techstack](skills-and-tech) and
* [highlights](previously) of my previous working experiences
