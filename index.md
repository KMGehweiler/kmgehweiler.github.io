# Task Breakdown

Karinâ€™s daily work included a wide range of tasks, mostly consisting of the handling of data related topics for legacy products on Windows, macOS and mobile OSes as well as for a completely new macOS product. Additionally, she performed administrative tasks related to the tracking platform Mixpanel and other topics such as internal education, cross-unit alignments and heavy involvement in the coordination and support of student projects.

The handling of data related topics was focused on the following tasks
* definition and reporting of KPIs
* error monitoring
* release monitoring
* topic deep dive analyses
* monitoring of user / product reactions to changes in the * market and environments (e.g. Redstone 5 release)
* data verification against other internal products
* data quality checks during implementation and live across tracking platforms
* dashboard creation and implementation of automatic reports

Specific to the legacy products
* feedback analysis
* implementation new standards (feedback and data collection)

Specific to the new macOS product
* definition of a cross-tracking-platform data design, compatible with company wide standards
* enabling company focus on experimentation (e.g. A/B-testing)

The responsibilities in the area of Mixpanel administration consisted of
* complete restructuring and reworking of the tracking as a reaction to GDPR
* regular sync meetings with Mixpanel to streamline and advance the partnership
* project, user and usage administration

Aside from the already mentioned, Karin also took on responsibilities in various other areas including
* organisation of external, internal and self-executed trainings (mainly on Mixpanel)
* supervision of a student project to create a proof of concept on natural language processing with AWS within the existing feedback processing pipeline
* cross-unit data & insights sharing and alignment on processes

To achieve all of this she developed a strong grip on  tools like Mixpanel, Tableau, data lake (AWS Athena), Survey Monkey, Jupyter, Python, Google Analytics and Atlassian. This was enhanced by her understanding of topics such as GDPR, MVP and personas, experimentation, user lifetime journey, AAARRR metrics and usability & UX Design.
